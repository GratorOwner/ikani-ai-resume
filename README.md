# ikani-ai-resume
This is an experiment in having an AI driven resume.
This repository contains the code for my AI driven resume. 
My hope is to make the resume interactive, engaging and fun. 
I want recruiters to be able to look at not just a flat pdf file like so many other resumes.
With the rise in AI technology, there's so much more that can be done with a resume.
Much like companies now have AI agents for things like customer service, I can create an AI agent driven resume,
that will allow recruiters to scan projects and live data, make queries and find out what I'm working on currently.
Stack is: React. Qdrant. OpenAi. Supabase.
